# Anagrams
The application checks two strings whether they are anagrams. Application uses StringAnagramChecker class, which has a static method named isAnagram. The method gets two input Strings and return Boolean value (true if they are anagrams, or false otherwise). The application accepts Strings, containing any printable symbols, including letters, digits and special symbols. The comparison is case-insensitive. If input strings have different lengths, the method throws DifferentLengthException exception. DifferentLengthException is a class inherited from the Exception class.
Also, StringAnagramCheckerTest class was created to test the written code automatically using Junit framework.
Comparing strings are passed to the application as command line parameters.
