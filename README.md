# Anagrams
The application checks two strings whether they are anagrams. Application uses class StringAnagramChecker, which has a static method named isAnagram. The method gets two input strings and return Boolean value (true if they are anagrams, or false otherwise). The comparison is case-insensitive. Spaces are handled as regular letters. If input strings have different length method throws an exception DifferentLengthException. DifferentLengthException is a class inherited from the Exception class. Also, class StringAnagramCheckerTest was created to test the written code automatically using Junit tests. Comparing strings are passed to the application as command line parameters.
